============================================

The project objective is to use a pcap file (or a live pcap stream) 
to extract potential indicators that can be used for the vulnerability 
(or the non-vulnerability) assessment of software seen in the network capture.

1- the first Program indicator_code.py :

   take a pcap file entry and return as User Agents and servers with their ip adresses

    1.1- Requirements :

		a- to use our project we need Scapy 2.2 library
		b- python 2.7.x

	1.2- How to Use :

		a - download the files in the same folder
		b - compile with the command : python indicator_code.py name_of_your_capture.pcap
		    or put your capture file and rename it to : test.pcap then put it in the same folder of indicator_code.py
            then just compile with : python indicator_code.py
		
		
		
2- the second Program indicator_CVSS.py :

   take a list of cpe vector in entry and return as the max value of CVSS score 
   and the average of all CVSS's for each cpe vector

   note : 
   the program must be used with another program like "CVE search" wich give us 
   a list of vector cpe "piped" with our program in order to have the results
   ( see How to use section for more informations )

   2.1- Requirements :
		
		a- Python 3.x
		b- CVE Search program, you can found it here : http://adulau.github.com/cve-search/
		   download and install it in folder with name : "adulau" 
		   the folder "adulau" and indicator_CVSS must be in the same folder 
		   or modify the path in line 12 of our program indicating the path to find the file search.py
		
		
   2.2- How To use :
   
		we need a list of cpe vector to use it with indicator_CVSS.py, we can use CVE search for testing our script
		like that :
		
		python3.2 /adulau/search.py -p firefox | grep cpe | indicator_CVSS.py
